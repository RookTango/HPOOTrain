dfb0e38b-67be-4e55-9997-77b09c8c5b62.description=<pre>\nThis subflow was created by the Web Services Wizard to invoke the GetCitiesByCountry operation on http\://www.webservicex.com/globalweather.asmx?WSDL. Note that the inputs to this flow which correspond to web service inputs are optional inputs.  This is due to the fact that web services definitions usually incorrectly indicate that too many inputs are required, and mirroring those settings in the flow would force you to enter unused values when running the flow.  The xmlTemplate input on the Invoke Method 2 step of this flow contains a template of the xml message to be sent, and the fields preceded by the comment "<\!--Optional\:-->" or "<\!--zero or more repetitions-->" are those which the web service indicates are optional; all others are indicated to be required.\n\nInputs\:\n    webserviceHost - The host that is running the web service\n    webservicePort - The port on the host running the web service\n    GetCitiesByCountry.CountryName - The input named GetCitiesByCountry|CountryName of the complex type\: GetCitiesByCountry\n\nResults\:\n    document - The raw XML response of the web service\n    documentStripped - The XML response of the web service stripped of namespaces\n    GetCitiesByCountryResult - The output given by the XPath\: /Envelope/Body/GetCitiesByCountryResponse/GetCitiesByCountryResult/text()\n\nResponses\:\n    success - The SOAP command was accepted by the web service\n    failure - Something went wrong while making the SOAP request\n</pre>
